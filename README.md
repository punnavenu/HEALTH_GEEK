# MULTIVITAMIN CONTENTS, THEIR ACTUAL DV% AND TOXIC LEVEL %
Personally I have always been a Geek when comes to Health , But thanks to my Bad Memory I cannot remember them all, just like most of them out there(If you do Pat urself on the back)



The Multivitamin companies taking advantage of this are manufacturing the Tabs with more than Daily limit Values



Being the Time of Pandemic every one got aware of the benefits of Multivitamins and started to use them (Talking about the people who have never used them).People make wrong choices, But when it comes to Health we cannot afford them

So I made a List of Most included ingredients in every multivitamin across Diff Brands and made a table with 
COL1 - NAME 
COL2 - Intent and Uses
COL3 - Original Intake Daily Value
COL4 - Upper limit (Dangerous amount)

I have bought a Multivitamin from a company called DYMATIZE which made me doubt the mutlivitamins and their effectiveness 

NOTE: These values are taken from the website https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-all/     U.S. Department of Health & Human Services 
National Institutes of Health  which is like a paragon of Health Info websites
The internet is filled of Fake info, hence the best has to be chosen 
if the ingredient is not in the list dont hesitate to visit the above mentioned link .... there is abundant of info ...Its worth evreyones time
